One Good Turn Deserves a Ternary
During your Ruby adventures, you’ve seen that you often have many options when it comes to accomplishing any one goal. The if statement is no exception!

An even more concise version of if/else is the ternary conditional expression. It’s called “ternary” because it takes three arguments: a boolean, #
an expression to evaluate if the boolean is true, and an expression to evaluate if the boolean is false.
